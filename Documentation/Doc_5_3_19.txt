The current scenario is:

1.	The client connects to the superserver.
2.	The superserver forks a new process(handler process) and assigns that process 
	to manage the client.
3.	The client sends the cpp file along with the question number and roll number
	to the handler process.
4.	The handler process then compiles the cpp code and creates a binary.
5.	The handler then duplicates the file descriptor of I/O and excecs the binary in 
	its child process.
6.	The three cases are taken care by handler namely correct execution, run time and
	time limit exceeded.
7.	The database is updated if the result is correct. This database updation is done by
	the handler itself. As at a time many handlers are running this might lead to concurrency 
	issues.
	Instead what I am planning is to have a database server running where the handler will
	send the result and that database handler will update accordingly.
